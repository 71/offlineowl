Offline Owl
===========


I really like [Duolingo]; however, even as a [Plus](https://www.duolingo.com/plus) subscriber,
their amazing [dictionary] remains online-only, which prevents me from looking up words
I have forgotten on-the-go while in Korea.

This web-app provides an interface similar to [Duolingo]'s [dictionary], with an added detail:
**all queried words are saved to the browser's storage**, which allows anyone to bring up
the website offline to lookup cached words.

A pretty recent browser is needed.
